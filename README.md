# ElegantPy: PEP-8 Pro
![](path/to/your/image.png)


This project serves as a demonstration of writing code that adheres to the guidelines outlined in PEP-8, the official style guide for Python code. It showcases the ideal coding practices and conventions recommended by the Python community.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to provide a clear and well-structured example of how code can be organized and formatted following the guidelines in PEP-8. It aims to illustrate the following aspects of PEP-8:

1. Formatting guidelines for comments, variable and function names, imports, and other code elements.
2. Proper use of whitespace, line breaks, and indentation.
3. Documentation practices using docstrings and appropriate function and class annotations.
4. Order of code elements such as imports, constants, classes, functions, and assignments.
5. Naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes (e.g., snake_case, CamelCase).

## Getting Started

To explore the code and see the PEP-8 guidelines in action, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Python development environment.
3. Review the code files to observe the adherence to PEP-8 guidelines.
4. Experiment with making changes to the code and observe the impact on code readability and conformity to PEP-8.
